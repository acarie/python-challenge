Space for module 3 challenge

PyBank and PyPoll have comments that guide user step by step

stackoverflow was used for new line command

could not figure out how to get month to appear in results analysis but everything else is there. The csv file was easy to open and set parameters for reading. The path seems to be a bit finnicky but runs well once opened in VS code. The results were successfully cloned into txt file.

PyPoll was a litle more difficult. Was able to set variables and parameters but could not figure out loop to work properly.
